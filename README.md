# Pandas Basics

This is a set of notebooks designed for basic introductory level training for all data scientists. The idea is that a data scientist should be able to express oneself using pandas easily, as without pandas, it would be difficult to wrangle data quickly and efficiently. 

## Getting started

To get started with this repo, please open `questions.ipynb`, the notebook that contains a series of questions that stem from the famous Titanic dataset. 

## Solutions 

Once you have attempted all the questions, please refer to the `solutions.ipynb` file to see the answers.
